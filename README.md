# Linear-regression-and-its-regularizations
Linear regression model is widely used in industry for regression tasks as it is straightforward and easy to interpret. To capature non-linear patterns in data, polynomial features need to be added. However, high-degree polynomial features lead to overfitting. To solve the problem, regularizations can be added to the loss function.
